        <h2>About community science museum</h2>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early
          understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything
          from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they
          only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).
        </p>

            <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
            <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
