          <h2>About community science museum</h2>
          <p>
            Over the course of human history, science has developed from our
            early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring
            everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of
            life itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
            lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but
            brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000
            different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to
            explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact
            with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the
            dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s
            gone home).

            Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be delivering 3 lectures
            on the development of aeronautics and where the future lies in this

            Energetica Exhibition on Loan
          </h3>
          <p>
            On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica
            exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series
            of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the
            elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
            wind to create power.
